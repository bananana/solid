        <p>
            {{ site_name }} (“{{ site_name }}”) welcomes you. {{ site_name }} provides its service to you
            subject to the following Terms of Service (“TOS”), which may be
            updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review
            the most current version of the TOS at any time at on our website at

        </p>
        <h3>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h3>
        <p>
            {{ site_name }} provides users with access to an application to document
            problems and gather a community to solve them which may be accessed
            through various media or devices (the “Service”). You also understand
            and agree that the Service may include invitations to donate and that
            these donations are necessary for {{ site_name }} to provide the Service. You
            also understand and agree that the Service may include certain
            communications from {{ site_name }}, such as service announcements,
            administrative messages and the {{ site_name }} Newsletter, and that these
            communications are considered part of {{ site_name }} membership and you will
            not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated
            otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current
            Service shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the
            Service is provided “AS-IS” and that {{ site_name }} assumes no responsibility
            for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any
            user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible
            for obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve
            third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime
            charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees
            associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In
            addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment
            necessary to access the Service.

            3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
        </h3>
        <p>
            In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you
            are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person

            other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true,
            accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted
            by the Service’s registration or other forms (the “Registration Data”)
            and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it
            true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information
            that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or {{ site_name }} has
            reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue,
            inaccurate, not current or incomplete, {{ site_name }} has the right to suspend
            or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use
            of the Service (or any portion thereof). {{ site_name }} is concerned about the
            safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this
            reason, parents of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow
            their children access to the Service must take responsibility to
            determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content (as defined
            in Section 6 below) are appropriate for your child.
