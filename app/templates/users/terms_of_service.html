            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
            <p>Bsolid (“Bsolid”) welcomes you. Bsolid provides its service to you subject to the following Terms of Service (“TOS”), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at on our website at http://www.Bsolid.com. This version was updated on July 25th, 2016. Bsolid is a project of Brandworkers International, Inc.</p>
            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h4>
            <p>Bsolid provides users with access to an application to document problems and gather a community to solve them which may be accessed through various media or devices (the “Service”). You also understand and agree that the Service may include invitations to donate and that these donations are necessary for Bsolid to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Bsolid, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Bsolid Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Bsolid membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided “AS-IS” and that Bsolid assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.</p>
            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h4>
            <p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration or other forms (the “Registration Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Bsolid has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Bsolid has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). Bsolid is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this reason, parents of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children access to the Service must take responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content (as defined in Section 6 below) are appropriate for your child.</p>
            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">4. Bsolid PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
            <p>Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy. We will not share or sell your email with another company without your permission. You understand that through your use of the Service you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in this Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Bsolid.</p>
            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</h4>
            <p>You may receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service’s registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Bsolid of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Bsolid cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.</p>
            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">6. USER CONDUCT</h4>
            <p>You understand that all information, data, text, software, photographs, graphics, messages, tags, or other materials (“Content”), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Bsolid, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. Bsolid does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.

In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Bsolid or submitted to Bsolid.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge, consent and agree that Bsolid may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Bsolid, its users and the public.</p>

Bsolid may, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who may be repeat infringers.

            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">24. GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>Entire Agreement. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Bsolid and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Bsolid with respect to the Service. Where local law is in conflict with these Bsolid Terms of Use as they apply to municipal employees, and a contract between Bsolid and that municipality exists, said contract will dictate any exceptions to the Terms of Use as they apply to the employees of that municipality. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Bsolid services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.</p>
            <p>Choice of Law and Forum. The TOS and the relationship between you and Bsolid shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Bsolid agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, NY.</p>
            <p>Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Bsolid to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability. You agree that your Bsolid account is non-transferable and any rights to your Bsolid login or contents within your account terminate upon your death.</p>
            <p>Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
            <p>The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
            <h4 class="u-add-margin-top">25. VIOLATIONS</h4>
